# F_CITY
## this is a project from the IT students of Cassino university.
Our project is about a new model for a not so far future city.
This model associates to each citizen a unique Id that is used, for instances, to be identified or establish payments.
Our aim is to simplify and improve daily actions as to identify themselves in public structures (e.g. airports).
In the futuristic city many daily actions are simplified, this project simulates two of them:

1. A client willing to buy an item from a shop.

2. A passenger intent to stamp the bus ticket.

In the first case the system will fetch user's bank data following all security procedures to perform payments. Moreover, in the second scenario the system will verify status of the user ticket.

We are presenting two examples to explain how our idea works, in general, everything is disposed to future implementations.
